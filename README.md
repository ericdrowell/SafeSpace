# Code Coverage
to run code coverage, use `npm run coverage`, then open up the game and play it, then access code coverage results in browser via `JSON.stringify(window.__coverage__);`, copy that json, and put it in coverage/coverage.json. Then run `npm run report`, and open up the generated html page inside the coverage directory
